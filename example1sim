/*      Job Example 2 
move_all_joints takes 5 angles in degrees, one for each 
of Dexter's joints.
move_to takes an xyz position (in meters from Dexter's base),
where you want the end effect to end up.
Beware, the 2nd and 3rd args to move_to determine the ending
J5_direction and which way the joints go. 
These are tricky to get right.
